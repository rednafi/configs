This repository reflects my workspace setup. I like to keep my work machine as stateless
as possible; meaning I can completely wipe out the OS, start over everything from
scratch, and become productive within an hour at max. Here I've documented a few
building blocks of the orchestration, for example‚Äîdotfiles, configurations, scripts to
run after a new OS installation, and steps to carry out so that I don't find myself
fumbling for missing pieces while I'm working on something, etc.

## OS settings

* OS                    : MacOS Ventura
* Terminal              : Gnome terminal.
* Shell                 : Zsh with a simple 5 lines custom plugin manager.
* Mono Font             : SF Mono

## OS pre installation steps

* Take a backup of the following entities and put them in a folder called `backup`:
    * `.ssh` directory
    * `.zshrc`, `.zsh_history`, `.zprofile`
    * `.ovpn` config
    * `.env` files and the credentials of disparate projects

## OS post installation steps

### Create directory layout

* Work and personal project directory layout should always have the following structure:

    ```
    ~/Canvas
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ company_a
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project_1
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_2
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ company_b
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project_1
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_2
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ personal
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project_1
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project_2
    ```
* To create the above project directory layout, run:

    ```
    mkdir -p ~/Canvas/<company_name> && mkdir -p ~/Canvas/personal
    ```
* Before starting to restore things, put the `backup` folder temporarily in the
`~/Canvas/personal/` directory.

### Restore SSH

* Copy the backup ssh keys into the `~/.ssh` folder:

    ```
    cp -r backup/.ssh/* ~/.ssh
    ```
* Change folder permission:

    ```
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.ssh
    chmod -R 700 ~/.ssh
    ```
* If you've changed the username from `rednafi` to anything else, in that case, you've
to regenerate the public ssh key from the private key.

    First copy the `id_rsa` private key to the `~/.ssh` folder and change the permission
    via the commands stated above. Then run:

    ```
    ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa > ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    ```

### Restore .zshrc & zsh_history

* Install Zsh if it's not already installed:

    ```
    sudo apt install zsh -y
    ```
* Change shell to Zsh:

    ```
    sudo chsh -s $(command -v zsh)
    ```
* Overwrite `.zshrc`:

    ```
    cp ~/Canvas/personal/backup/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
    ```
* Overwrite `.zsh_history`:

    ```
    cp ~/Canvas/personal/backup/.zsh_history ~/.zsh_history
    ```

### Install tools

Although all of these tools are download via scripts, they still need some manual
supervision. That's why it's better to run them one by one instead of in a single go.

* Install Homebrew:

    ```
    /bin/bash -c \
        "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```

* By default, macOS is shipped with a really old version of Bash for licensing issues.
Let's update that first:

    ```
    brew install bash
    ```
* Install Python. Python is installed with `asdf` CLI version manager. First, install
`asdf`:

    ```
    brew install asdf
    ```

    Add `asdf` Python plugin:

    ```
    asdf plugin-add python
    ```

    Install your preferred version of Python:

    ```
    asdf install python 3.11.1
    ```

    Set up global Python version:

    ```
    asdf global Python 3.11.1
    ```

* Similarly, install NodeJS and Golang by following the instructions [here][4]. Also,
checkout the `./.tool-versions` config file to see how `asdf` managed CLIs are
configured.
